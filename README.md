# Fridge Tracker

## Overview

Fridge Tracker is a client-side JavaScript web application. It helps users manage the food in their fridges more easily. The app allows users to add food items, track expiry dates, view food logs, check reminders, update profile information and join shared groups to use the app with family members or roommates.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for managing user data, food items, reminders and shred groups.
